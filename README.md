# Trojan-Expedition
TrojanExpeditions allows users to register for an account and view, post, and 
respond to various locations and location reviews. There is also a forum 
functionality where students can update each other on certain 
happenings/closures on these locations around campus. Unregistered/logged out users can still view all data but donâ€™t have the ability to 
post or respond to anything.
